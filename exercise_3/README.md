# Exercise 3: prediction of the winner of a nba game (classification)

## Subject

We would like to predict the winner of a Basketball game, as a function of the
data gathered at half-time.

The dataset is stored in ```project/ex_3_classification_NBA/```:
- The inputs x representing the features are stored in inputs.npy.
- The labels y are stored in labels.npy. If the home team wins, the label is 1, âˆ’1
otherwise.

You are free to choose the classification method. However, it is required that you
explain and discuss your approach in your report. For instance, you could discuss :
- the performance of several methods and models that you tried.
- the choice of the hyperparameters and the method to tune them.
- the optimization procedure.

Your objective should be to obtain a mean accuracy superior than 0.85 on a test
set or as a cross validation score.

Several methods might work, including some methods that we have not explici-
tely studied in the class. Do not hesitate to try such methods.

overview of classification and how to do it with sklearn: https://stackabuse.com/overview-of-classification-methods-in-python-with-scikit-learn/

## Solution

Managed to get a precision of ```0.904``` basically copying code from a tutorial (see main sources).

This seems waaaay too easy.

This method uses logistic regression, but the exercise 4 is supposed to be about regression

The subject also requires explaining the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization procedure, which I did not do.

Clearly I missed something.

- did I solve it in the wrong way ?
- used tools I wasn't allowed to use ?
- misunderstand the objective ?
