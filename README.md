## Subject

See ```MLI_supervised_learning_project.pdf```.

## Installation

This process has been tested with python3.10, using other versions may cause issues.

Create a virtual env:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install requirements:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Report

The report files can be found in ```report/```.

The report is a pdf file written in latex and generated using pdflatex.

The process of installing latex tools is complicated and platform dependent (and annoying), so it won't be explained here.

## Todo

Exercise 5: everything

Report:
- add exercise 3, 4
- improve appearance (new pages when necessary, more space between lines, better sections, etc...)
- add bibliography
- add justifications for additional dependencies in introduction
